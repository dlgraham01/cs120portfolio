        <p> I wanted to take this class because I want to gain full stack development skills at an accelerated rate in order to be able to complete projects this semester using HTML/CSS, JS, MongoDB, and JS Node. I have no previous web dev skills, but I have taken CS11, CS15 and am currently taking CS105.

        <a href="https://www.duckfat.com/">My Favorite Restaurant</a>
        <p>
            This is my favorite restaurant. It's called DUCKFAT and you can find it in Portland, ME. They fry all their fried menu items in duck fat and make dishes like loaded fries, poutine, and doughnut holes.

        <p>This is duck fat poutine that has been topped with a fried egg.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This is a dish you can get at DUCKFAT.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My favorite way to eat it is hot out of the fryer and with friends!</p>
